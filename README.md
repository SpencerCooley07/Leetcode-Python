# Python Leetcode Solutions
This repository is a constant work in progress which has all my solutions for Leetcode problems as I go through them. All solutions have passed the Leetcode testcases, have a time and space complexity listed (they may be incorrect), and a performance timer.  
  
DISCLAIMER: These solutions may not be the most optimal, they are simply the best I have come up with.

## Completed Problems
| Code | Name | Time | Space |
| :---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `0238` | Product of Array Except Self | O(n) | O(1) |
| `1742` | Maximum Numer of Balls in a Box | O(nâˆ—logH) | O(logH) |
| `3038` | Maximum Number of Operations With the Same Score I | O(n) | O(1) |
| `3110` | Score of a String | O(n) | O(1) |
