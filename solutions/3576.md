# Intuition
We need to find a way to flip (multiply by `-1`) elements in `nums` to satisfy the condition (make all elements equal) in `k` or lower operations.

# Approach
## First Step - Guard Clause
To avoid unnecessary computation when provided a test which requires no flips, we can add the guard clause:
```python
if abs(sum(nums)) == len(nums): return True
```
This immediately returns `True` as it requires 0 operations to satisfy the condition and `1 <= k <= len(nums)`

## Second Step - When is the Condition Impossible?
As the only operation afforded to us is a "flip" it follows that the condition can be met **if and only if** the number of elements that we choose to flip (`-1` or `1`) is even.
```python
[1, 1, 1,-1,-1] # Here is our intial "nums" list

# Swapping only -1 elements
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1] # If there is an even amount we can easily flip them

# Swapping only 1 elements
[-1,-1, 1,-1,-1] # OR
[-1, 1,-1,-1,-1] # OR
[ 1,-1,-1,-1,-1]
# It is evident that odd amounts of the target element can never resolve
```
> So there must be an even number of our target `-1` or `1`

## Third Step - How Many Operations?
So now we know there is an even number of our target, we need to determine how many flips are required given any pair of the target element.
```python
# Our target will be -1

# Elements Between: 0
[-1,-1, 1, 1, 1] # n=0
[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] # n=1 | Condition is met

# Elements Between: 1
[-1, 1,-1, 1, 1] # n=0
[ 1,-1,-1, 1, 1] # n=1
[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] # n=2 | Condition is met

# Elements Between: 2
[-1, 1, 1,-1, 1] # n=0
[ 1,-1, 1,-1, 1] # n=1
[ 1, 1,-1,-1, 1] # n=2
[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] # n=3 | Condition is met

# etc.
```
In these examples it is evident that the number of operations required is the elements in between the two indexes + 1, or more simply:
```python
LastIndex - FirstIndex
```

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        s = sum(nums)
        if abs(s) == len(nums): return True

        indexPos = [i for i, num in enumerate(nums) if num == 1]
        indexNeg = [i for i, num in enumerate(nums) if num == -1]

        count, posLen = 0, len(indexPos)
        if posLen % 2 == 0:
            for i in range(1,len(indexPos),2):
                count += (indexPos[i]-indexPos[i-1])
            if count <= k: return True

        count, negLen = 0, len(indexNeg)
        if negLen % 2 == 0:
            for i in range(1,len(indexNeg),2):
                count += (indexNeg[i]-indexNeg[i-1])
            if count <= k: return True

        return False
